##Description

With this application, customers have the option to order online in a simple and efficient manner, while benefiting from the flexibility to choose between secure online payment or payment upon delivery. Orders are sent in real-time through the application, enabling the pizzeria manager to react instantly.

But that's not all! Customers can also book directly from the application, while the administrator easily manages all bookings.

And to ensure that the menu remains up-to-date at all times, our application gives full control to the pizzeria: it can modify the menu as desired, add new specialties, or remove dishes based on seasons or customer preferences.
